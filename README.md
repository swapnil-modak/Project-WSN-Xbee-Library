# Project-WSN-Xbee-Library
A software library is being developed to provide simple interfaces to Motesquitoâ€™s peripherals. Due to the hardware being similar to the Arduino Mega, it is possible for a user to load the Arduino bootloader onto the microcontroller and use the Arduino XBee library to interface with the XBee module. However, for applications where the user needs full control of the hardware, a C library will be created to provide simple functions to construct and send packages, receive packages, and change XBee settings. The library will also support both series 1 and series 2 XBee modules, and expand to other types of wireless modules which have been developed to use the XBee footprint. By using the XBee footprint and allowing the wireless module to be interchangeable, it is easy for developers to change the wireless interface. The use of avrgcc and XBee makes debugging problems easy because the hardware is widely documented and has large support groups online. The library will include a hardware abstraction layer, so users can use the software with other microcontrollers.
